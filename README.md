# Intrinsic

# Getting started

## Windows

### Prerequisites

* Qt 5.7
* ...

Coming soon...

## Linux

### Limitations

* Only the core library and the main standalone application are currently setup for Linux builds, IntrinsicEd support is only partially completed (nothing is speaking against supporting IntrinsicEd and the support for it will be added in the future)
* Microprofile is currently disabled in Linux builds due to errors in the Linux path of the library

Coming soon...

## Android

IntrinsicEd is neither configured for nor tested with Android - but the support is planned for the future.
